# ❄️ Whiteout Survival Autopilot — Mac Port (WOS-Bot)

Automation suite for Whiteout Survival, ported to Apple Silicon Macs running the game
in **MuMuPlayer Pro** over **adb**. Text OCR runs on **Apple Vision**
(`VNRecognizeTextRequest`, Neural Engine, ~17ms/crop) with PaddleOCR as the guarded
fallback/rollback engine; icons use OpenCV template matching, with `rapidfuzz`
absorbing OCR misreads.

This is a fork of the upstream Linux/Windows bot, pinned to upstream `c7951f19`
(tagged 0.8.0) on branch `mac-port`. The full port record — what the original brief
got wrong, every review, decision, and finding — lives in
[`docs/port/INDEX.md`](docs/port/INDEX.md). Read it before touching the code.

## Current state

- **v1 daily loop verified live**: mail collected, gather deployed with an adaptive
  per-player node level, and an immediate re-run correctly skips on cooldown.
- **Offline test suite**: `uv run pytest tests/ -q` → 146 passed. No emulator, no adb,
  no network needed.
- Linux-only paths (scrcpy/v4l2 streaming) are untouched but unused on macOS —
  the launcher forces `OCR_CAPTURE_TOOL=adb`.

---

## How it works

1. **OCR engine** — a local FastAPI OCR server (`core/ocr.py`, port 8210 under
   `run.sh` — see `OCR_PORT` below) reads text
   with Apple Vision (`core/vision_engine.py`, request revision pinned) or PaddleOCR,
   selected by `OCR_ENGINE` (unset = vision on macOS >= 13, paddle elsewhere);
   `core/core.py` matches icons with OpenCV templates from `references/icon/`.
   Reads whose text feeds numeric state are tagged `read_kind="value"`: a zero-item
   Vision read on a value crop falls back to a one-shot lazy Paddle read of the same
   crop (label polls never fall back — absent text is their normal state), and during
   burn-in every value read is shadow-checked by Paddle (`logs/ocr_burnin.jsonl`,
   verdict via `uv run python scripts/burnin_report.py [path-to-jsonl]`; waive
   individual DIGIT_MISMATCH decisions by listing their decision_ids in
   `logs/burnin_waivers.txt`; exit criteria in
   [`docs/designs/vision-ocr-swap.md`](docs/designs/vision-ocr-swap.md)).
   **Rollback runbook:** `OCR_ENGINE=paddle ./run.sh` — one variable, restart, done.
   Fresh machines: prefetch Paddle models once (`uv run python -c "from paddleocr import PaddleOCR; PaddleOCR(lang='en')"`)
   — the bot never downloads models mid-session.
2. **Percentage-based ROIs** — screen regions in `references/TextArea/*.json` are
   percentages against the canonical 1080×2460 base declared in `core/coord_utils.py`.
   The bot is *not* pixel-hardcoded, but the emulator must present a 1080×2460
   framebuffer (see below).
3. **Task loop** — `Main/main.py` launches the game on the pinned adb device, reads
   the active player from the in-game Chief Profile, runs the selected tasks, then
   cycles through sibling characters on the same email before switching to the next
   account by priority. Completion is recorded per player in `db/completion_log.txt`
   with a 3-hour skip window.
4. **Per-player profile** — `db/players/<id>.json` (seeded from
   `db/players/example.json`, reseeded if corrupt) persists name, state, furnace
   level, and the gather node level. Each run probes one level above the last
   known-good level (capped at 8); the level is lowered only when a failed search is
   proven by the camera not jumping, and the level that actually worked is saved for
   next time.

## Requirements (macOS)

- Apple Silicon Mac
- [MuMuPlayer Pro](https://www.mumuplayer.com/mac/) with Whiteout Survival installed
- Homebrew `android-platform-tools` (adb) and `uv`
- Python 3.12+ (managed by `uv` — `pyproject.toml` pins `requires-python >= 3.12`)

```bash
brew install android-platform-tools uv
```

## Emulator setup (once)

1. Create a MuMuPlayer Pro instance with a **1080×2460 @ 420dpi** display
   (Pixel 8 profile). Enable adb; the first instance listens on `127.0.0.1:16384`.
2. The shipped ROIs assume a ~120px top safe-area inset. MuMu's own cutout setting
   maxes out at 72px, so enable the tall cutout overlay inside Android instead
   (126px @ 420dpi, survives reboot):

   ```bash
   adb connect 127.0.0.1:16384
   adb -s 127.0.0.1:16384 shell cmd overlay enable \
     com.android.internal.display.cutout.emulation.tall
   ```

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this repo> wos-bot && cd wos-bot
uv sync

cp db/account.json.example db/account.json
# edit db/account.json with your account(s) — see Configuration below

./run.sh
```

`run.sh` does the rest, in order:

1. Pins adb to `127.0.0.1:${WOS_ADB_PORT:-16384}` and exports
   `OCR_CAPTURE_TOOL=adb` (no scrcpy/v4l2 needed on macOS).
2. **Gates on the real framebuffer**: takes a screencap and exits unless it is
   exactly 1080×2460 — `wm size` output is not trusted.
3. Starts the OCR server and waits for it to come up (seconds under the vision
   engine; under `OCR_ENGINE=paddle`, PaddleOCR downloads models on first run,
   which can take a while once).
4. Launches the bot as `python -m Main.main` and opens the interactive task selector.

## Task selection

At startup, `Main/task_menu.py` shows a menu. Select tasks by number (`1,3,6`),
key (`vip,mail,heal`), or title; press **Enter** (or `all`/`default`/`*`) for the
full default list:

| # | Task | # | Task |
| :-- | :--- | :-- | :--- |
| 1 | VIP Rewards | 11 | Labyrinth |
| 2 | Exploration Idle Income | 12 | Alliance Auto Join |
| 3 | Continue Exploring | 13 | Alliance Chests |
| 4 | Mail Rewards | 14 | Alliance Tech |
| 5 | Life Essence | 15 | Alliance Help |
| 6 | Train Troops | 16 | Alliance Triumph |
| 7 | Arena | 17 | Heal |
| 8 | Chief Order | 18 | World Gather |
| 9 | Ally Treasure | 19 | Missions Reward |
| 10 | Pet Exploration | | |

Tasks run in order; players completed within the last 3 hours are skipped
automatically.

## Configuration

`db/account.json` (never committed — see Security):

```json
{
  "your_email@gmail.com": {
    "priority": 1,
    "player": [
      { "id": "12345678", "name": "Your Chief Name" }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `priority` | Processing order — lower runs first |
| `id` | Player ID from the in-game Chief Profile |
| `name` | Character name used for character/account switching |

Multiple characters under one email are supported — the bot switches between them
automatically and verifies after each switch that it is still on the expected email.

With exactly one configured email the bot never opens the account-switch (Google
sign-in) flow: it runs one pass over that email's characters, prints
`Single account configured (<email>) - pass complete, exiting.`, and exits 0.

Environment knobs (all optional; `run.sh` sets the first three, the rest default
in code — `core/ocr.py`):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `WOS_ADB_PORT` | `16384` | MuMu instance adb port |
| `WOS_ADB_SERIAL` | `127.0.0.1:16384` | Fails loudly if set but the device is absent — no silent fallback |
| `OCR_CAPTURE_TOOL` | `adb` | Bypasses the Linux scrcpy/v4l2 path entirely |
| `OCR_ENGINE` | unset | `vision` (default on macOS >= 13) or `paddle` — the one-variable rollback |
| `OCR_PORT` | `8210` | OCR server port — dedicated so a dev server on 8000 can't impersonate it; `run.sh` refuses to start if anything already answers on it |
| `OCR_BURNIN` | `1` | Per-read JSONL + Paddle shadow-checks on value reads; flip to `0` after burn-in exit |
| `OCR_RAM_CAP_GB` | `16` | RAM guard reports honestly; the engine-recycle actuator stays dormant on macOS |

## Security

`db/account.json`, `db/players/*.json`, and `db/completion_log.txt` contain account
credentials and real player IDs. All are gitignored (only the templates
`db/account.json.example` and `db/players/example.json` are tracked) — keep it that
way, and never share the real files.

---

## Known hazards & gotchas

- **uv version**: a `~/.local/bin/uv` at 0.6.16 silently downgrades `uv.lock` from
  revision 3 to 2 on any `uv add`. Use `/opt/homebrew/bin/uv` for lockfile-mutating
  commands; `uv run` is unaffected.
- **Wrong-resolution emulator**: `run.sh` refuses to start if the framebuffer isn't
  1080×2460. Fix the MuMu display settings rather than bypassing the gate.

## Troubleshooting

- **OCR server never comes up** — under `OCR_ENGINE=paddle` the first run downloads
  PaddleOCR models; `run.sh` waits up to 4 minutes. If the OCR port is occupied,
  `run.sh` fails loudly before spawning: `lsof -i :8210`, kill the stale process
  (or set `OCR_PORT`), rerun.
- **adb device missing** — `adb kill-server && adb connect 127.0.0.1:16384`, and
  check the MuMu instance is running with adb enabled.
- **Taps land wrong / OCR misses** — verify the framebuffer
  (`adb exec-out screencap -p | file -`) and the cutout overlay from Emulator setup.

## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -q    # 146 passed — fully offline
```
