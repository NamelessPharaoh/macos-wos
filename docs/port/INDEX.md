# Mac port — full decision record

Everything about porting this bot to Apple Silicon: the origin brief, the reviews that
challenged it, the decisions made, and the execution ledger. Consolidated here on
2026-08-28 so the record lives with the code instead of scattered across
`~/.claude`, `~/.gstack` and `~/Downloads`.

**Upstream pin:** `c7951f19e8cdb7fadcdf947a0bc0c6e74b6b951f` (2026-05-02, tagged 0.8.0).
Work branch: `mac-port`. Upstream `main` has not moved since May 2026.

## Read in this order

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `00-original-brief.md` | The handoff brief that started this. Research on the WOS bot ecosystem, two candidate codebases, rejected alternatives, risks. **Three of its technical claims are wrong** — see below. |
| `01-plan-reviewed.md` | The implementation plan, after an engineering review, a Codex outside voice, and a CEO review. Ends with the GSTACK REVIEW REPORT. |
| `02-ceo-review.md` | Scope and premise challenge. The uncomfortable finding about account risk is here. |
| `03-test-plan.md` | What to test and where, including the parts that need a live emulator. |
| `04-execution-ledger.md` | Task-by-task execution record with every ruling made and what each costs if wrong. |
| `05-final-review-findings.md` | The five findings from the final whole-branch review, with root causes. |
| `briefs/` | The exact requirements handed to each implementer. |
| `reports/` | What each implementer did, with verification output. |
| `decisions/` | gstack decisions + learnings as JSONL. |

## What the brief got wrong

Verified against source at the pinned SHA, not assumed:

1. **The v4l2loopback/sudo patch it prescribes is unnecessary.** `core/ocr.py:301-308`
   returns early on the adb path and never reaches the loopback bootstrap. Setting
   `OCR_CAPTURE_TOOL=adb` (`core/ocr.py:118-122`) bypasses it with zero code changes.
   Confirmed at runtime: the server prints `✅ Using Capture Tool from Env: ADB`.
2. **The repo is not hardcoded to pixels.** ROIs in `references/TextArea/*.json` are
   percentages, and `core/coord_utils.py` declares the canonical 1080x2460 base.
3. **The 4px bug pointed the other way.** Taps were always correct; the OCR path squashed
   frames 0.16% and carried a `y1 -= 5` fudge to compensate.

It also missed two live bugs: `input_text()` raised `TypeError` on every call (breaking
the gathering task), and the RAM guard was completely inert on macOS.

## What was decided, and why

- **Option A (Python port), not Frostguard.** Faster to a working daily loop.
- **Account choice is an explicit up-front decision, not deferred.** The CEO review found
  the plan's own mitigation ("run on an account you accept losing") cancels its purpose:
  the chores worth automating only matter on an alliance main. Read `02-ceo-review.md`.
- **RAM sensor repaired, actuator held dormant.** `OCR_RAM_CAP_GB` defaults to 16 so the
  guard reports honest memory without arming an engine-recycle path that has never run on
  macOS. Lower it to 3 once the daily loop is stable.
- **`STREAM_WIDTH`/`STREAM_HEIGHT` deliberately left at 2456.** They still feed a
  Linux-only scrcpy path that cannot be tested from a Mac. Not an oversight.
- **`WOS_ADB_SERIAL` fails loudly when set but absent.** An earlier decision to fall back
  silently was reversed — silent substitution would tap a different device with rescaled
  frames and no error.

## State as of 2026-08-29

Done and verified (see the 2026-08-29 ledger section for evidence):

- `uv run pytest tests/ -q` → **30 passed**, no emulator, no adb, no network.
- Emulator live: MuMuPlayer Pro instance 0 at 1080x2460 @ 420dpi (Pixel 8 profile),
  adb pinned to 127.0.0.1:16384, Homebrew adb 37.0.1. `run.sh`'s framebuffer gate passes.
- **Phase 2.5 done, with a finding:** the shipped ROIs assume a ~120px top safe-area
  inset. Fixed in the emulator, not in code:
  `adb shell cmd overlay enable com.android.internal.display.cutout.emulation.tall`
  (126px @ 420dpi, survives reboot). MuMu's own cutout setting maxes at 72px.
- **Phase 5 mail: done.** Collected for real (mailbox badge cleared), cooldown entry in
  `db/completion_log.txt` (the actual store — nothing writes `db/players/*.json
  last_visit`; that plan claim was stale), and an immediate re-run **skips**. That was
  the v1 acceptance criterion for mail.
- Burner account: `lord846646676` (846646676), guest login, in `db/account.json`
  (gitignored).
- **Single-account mode: done.** With one configured email, `run_bot` never calls
  `change_account()` — it runs one pass and exits cleanly with a marker line. The
  guest-account hazard (change_account taps into Sign-in-with-Google before checking
  the target email) is resolved for 1-email configs; the marker watchdog is retired.
  See the 2026-08-29 single-account ledger section.

- **Phase 5 gather: done.** Adaptive node level (8→7→6) with camera-jump search
  detection; march deployed live and the per-player profile persisted the level.
  **v1 acceptance (D12) is met** — see the gather ledger section.

Still open:

- **ocr_endpoint opaque-500** — parked fast-follow (predates this branch).
- Alliance tasks and the other 15 modules remain unproven on the burner.

## Operational gotcha

`which uv` resolves to `~/.local/bin/uv` **0.6.16**, which silently downgrades
`uv.lock` from revision 3 to 2 on any `uv add`. Use `/opt/homebrew/bin/uv` for
lockfile-mutating commands. `uv run` is unaffected.
